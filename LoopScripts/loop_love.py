#   Exercise 4C Lab1


#   1. Create a script named loop_love.py.

#   2. Create a list of words that mean great such as amazing, awesome, excellent, etc.

#   3. Use a for loop to iterate through your list, and with each loop print out the phrase
#   Loops are ____!” filling in the blank with a word from the list.

#   4. When your loop has finished, print the additional phrase “I <3 loops”


#List all variables
great_syn = ['amazing' , 'awesome','excellent', 'great' , 'superb' , 'fantastic' , 'Really good']        #great synonyms = great_syn
x = ['a','b','c']
i = 0
y = 0
# Formulata all processes:

for i in great_syn:
    print(f'Loops are {i}!')

print(f"I <3 loops")


#Print all results
